# WooCommerce Bulk Variations

A WooCommerce utility to let customers add multiple product variations at once to 
cart. This might be useful for wholesale stores that are selling products to
customers where customers should be able to add a lot of products to the cart in
one go. The plugin adds the possibility to enable a bulk product form for variable
products.

## Setup

To set up the plugin, first install WooCommerce and then enable this plugin. All
products will show a "Bulk variation form settings" window on the sidebar when
editing a product on the admin backend. You can decide whether to enable or disable 
the bulk and single order form of the product page. If you enable the bulk form, 
you have to also edit the column and row attribute settings. Check the product page
for the resulting table.
